	\item
	% would love to do \verb|bert-base|, \verb|bert-large|, but `make` fails
	Bigger is usually better, but often not worth the marginal improvement:
	\verb|bert-large| offered an improvement of around 1 percentage point over
	\verb|bert-base|. Number of parameters: 340M vs.\ 110M
	\item
	...but bigger can be worse: making context size smaller helped to produce
	more specific responses
	\item
	a 95\% character recognition rate can make the words they occur in
	impossible for HUMANS to decipher, even with context
	\end{itemize}

	Potential improvements: enforce some constraints on selected words (matching
	length, matching characters); use a different token-based model, perhaps with only
	one side of the context; try a character based-model
