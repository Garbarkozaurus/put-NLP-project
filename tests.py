    It serves no purpose beyond being a short, generic example of natural
    language to test the process of loading and noisifying project data.
    The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog. Even more text for more
    accurate randomness. Often we want to create temporary files to save data
    that we can't hold in memory or to pass to external programs that must
    read from a file. The obvious way to do this is to generate a unique file
    name in a common system temporary directory.
    I work as an employee for the friendly neighbourhood department stores,
    and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I
    occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours
    of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing
    about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no
    problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any
    fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my
    last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live
    a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies,
    like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That
    is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness.
    Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."""
